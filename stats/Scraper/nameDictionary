# Assuming you have two lists of team names from each table
teams_table1 = ['Team A', 'Team B', 'Team C']
teams_table2 = ['Alpha Team', 'Beta Team', 'Gamma Team']

# Step 2: Create the mapping dictionary
name_mapping = {
    'Uconn': 'connecticut',
    'USC': 'southern california',
    'Pitt': 'pittsburgh',
    
}

# Step 3: Standardize the names in the tables
# For table1, you replace the names directly
standardized_teams_table1 = [name_mapping[team] for team in teams_table1]

# For table2, names are already in the standardized form, but you might want to ensure consistency
standardized_teams_table2 = [team if team in name_mapping.values() else 'Unknown' for team in teams_table2]

# Now you can proceed to merge your tables using standardized_teams_table1 and standardized_teams_table2
